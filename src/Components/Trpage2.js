      <p className='w-[80%] text-slate-600 mt-10 mx-auto'  >The part I was most looking forward to was our planned hike on the Great Wall that we booked through a local tour operator. I think before Covid, actual camping ON the wall was allowed, but this one only offered to camp next to it - still pretty cool. L set it up. We left our main baggage at the hotel and were picked up right on time at 10am. It would just be us - not a group tour. Yay! And they had a nice fancy volvo car to drive us the 90 minutes near the park entrance, where there is a little cultural center area here and seems to be a stopping point for lunch for many tourists. We had lunch here and there was so much food. Our guide, B, was pretty insistent on us 'trying' tofu, here they made locally (I think), and we also ordered a cashew chicken, vegetables, meat and potatoes, as well as a big bowl of purple rice. Most of the dishes were soaked in sauces, so I really could not eat that much, but I did like the cashew chicken a lot. <br /> <br />After lunch, we headed towards the actual wall entrance, a little further down the road and up a remote gravel drive. We packed up our bags and prepared to hike. Once again, it was quite hot. But we were excited! I mean, the Great Friggin Wall! And we seemingly had it to ourselves - the park was deserted. It was a nice area though, shaded under trees with a nice kids playground and a raised walkway on the other side of the dry creek bed. Soon, we broke out of the shade of trees and climbed straight up for about 20 minutes before reaching the first wall. I think 10 minutes into it I was thinking "dear god, what have I done?" But man, the views were just amazing. And because it was the three of us, there was no real rush nor were there excess photo delays. We just snapped a few photos and moved on. <br /> B was a great source of information for the most part. He called the wall the world's longest cemetery as about 1 million people had died during its construction, all for the greater good. This section of the wall was left in a semi-ruined state. The next day we would visit another section that was refurbished specifically for tourists. But I loved the rugged feel of this 500+ year old wall section, with crumbling watchtowers and narrow strips along the top of the wall to walk. It was an adventure! <br />A recurring theme, it was quite hot and we were able to take breaks from the sun in the many watchtowers along the route. These were all in various states of ruin, some gone completely, and a few a bit more sturdy. We walked until we got to the 24-Eye Tower, which is unique in having two full floors with 3 windows on each side on each floor. This was our end point for this portion as going further east was a military zone which was off-limits. <br /> Then we walked down along the north side of the wall for about 45 minutes or so along a pretty easy path in the woods. B was not a bug person, and at one point I heard him have a minor freakout and then say "oh! It was just a dragonfly...." Too cute. About halfway along the path, we got to the west entrance for the Jinshanling Great wall, taking a bit of a rest. Then it was a slight uphill walk along the path with nice views. I was happy because I saw storm clouds approaching and soon we heard a rumble of thunder. No rain yet, but thankfully we were near the farmhouse. <br /> <br /> We arrived at the farmhouse, B a bit surprised at the expansion of the building that he had not seen in a few years ("they must have been doing well before Covid"). We arrived and sat down getting a nice break and it was already starting to cool down. B took a shower and seemed surprised that we were ok not needing a shower. After about an hour, and smelling the spices, we had a home cooked dinner in their dining area. It was very good and I had a cold beer to wash it down. <br /> B had mentioned earlier that he was not much of a camper, usually doing the city tours. He had said, and I quote, that camping had "bugs, dirt, hard and uneven floors" and with the rain coming it would be bad. It was really only just a sprinkle for about 10 minutes then it moved on. I was initially amused and unfazed, but with the sprinkle, he seemed more reluctant than ever to camp in the tents that were already set up at the wall (they even showed us a picture, which looked awesome). He also said he was not a morning person. He asked the owners if we could stay in rooms, but they said it would be extra and I thought I had won... until he talked to the business manager of the family who said we could sleep there. He said it was ultimately up to us (yeah, sure), but I let it go. Even though the rain was gone, it was still very cloudy and therefore no stars and probably no real sunrise, so aside from sleeping next to the wall, there did not seem to be anything we would be missing, so why make him miserable. The family's small son, I think he was about 6, was trying to play with us and I indulged him for a while - he was very cute! But his energy level seemed to ratchet up as mine went down and soon, I was just crashing on the bed in the dark. And oh dear god, this was one of the hardest beds I had ever slept on - the ground would have been better. I did not sleep well at all and was grumpy in the morning - L commented frequently on my non-Tigger like usual morning persona. We sat at a random cafe in the mall for an hour then made our way easily to the airport - we were pros by now. We still had 4 hours before the flight so we had iced coffee while waiting for the checkin to open for the next leg of the adventure. <span className='text-xl font-bold' >More on that to come in the next blog!</span></p>
