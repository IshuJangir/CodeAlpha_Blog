      <p className='w-[80%] text-slate-600 mt-10 mx-auto' >As the couture shows continued to dazzle the runways in Paris, their impact has seamlessly transcended to our Bollywood starlets like Sonam Kapoor. The runways demanded the presence of our favourite celebrities, who took the opportunity to make front-row-worthy fashion statements. <br /> <br /> This week, our best-dressed celebrities truly stepped up in their sartorial game, inspiring us to bring new dynamics to our wardrobes. Scrolling past the carefully curated feed full of show-stopping looks, we witnessed an eclectic mix of vintage, high street, and designer pieces sported by our fashion savant. <br /> <br /> From a military necessity to now an iconic fashion piece, the trench coat has come a long way from the early days of Burberry and Aquascutum in the 1850s. In her recent look for Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Dior Haute Couture show in Paris, Sonam Kapoor bears testimony to this. Donning a full head-to-toe Dior look, the actress wore a beige-coloured midi dress paired with a double-breasted beige trench coat, serving serious lessons in laying—the Parisian style. <br /> Infusing a touch of vintage into 2023, Aditi Rao Hydari consistently incorporates Audrey Hepburn's timeless style into her own looks, once again. She captivated the internet with a series of pictures showcasing a John Paul Ataker dress, rendered as the perfect fusion of contemporary and classic elements. <br /> Also, channelling a delightful old-world retro energy, Bhumi Pednekar graced her Instagram with captivating pictures, donning a customized brown blazer elegantly paired with a slit pencil skirt. Her impeccably tailored ensemble exuded a harmonious fusion of androgyny and femininity, while a pair of effortlessly cool vintage-inspired sunglasses added a final touch of flair. <br /> Wrapping up the London schedule of the upcoming film Ulajh, actress Janhvi Kapoor shared some behind-the-scenes glimpses of her look in a monochrome filter. Kapoor’s look served as a reminder of the elegance of simplicity by wearing a simple shirt paired with trousers.</p>
